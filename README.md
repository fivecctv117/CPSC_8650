# CPSC_8650 Course project
We design and implement three different deep learning methods for the provided MRI brain image regression task:
1. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
2. Pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT)
3. Autoencoder + CNN Regression

Each folder, `01-MLP-Nathan`, `02-ViT-Shuhao`, and `03-AE-Li` contain the respective implementation for each deep learning method.
